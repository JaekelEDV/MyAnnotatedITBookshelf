## Publisher

Some of my favorite publisher...

**No Starch Press**</br>
<font size="1"><https://nostarch.com/></font>

> Imho you can buy almost every title. You won't regret. I never did.

**Manning Publications**</br>
<font size="1"><https://www.manning.com/></font>

> Well-known for awesome Powershell books. Interesting: MEAP - Manning Early Access Program. Read the book from the very beginning, before it is finished. Very interesting concept in our fast paced field.

**O'Reilly**</br>
<font size="1"><https://www.oreilly.com/></font>

> Everybody knows O'Reilly books. Lots of standards. Read about the history of their famous and sometimes quirky animal-covers: <font size="1"><https://www.oreilly.com/content/a-short-history-of-the-oreilly-animals/></font>

**Syngress/ Elsevier**</br><font size="1"><https://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/syngress/></font>

> Extreme cool and exceptionally advanced titles. A lot of nuggets to find here. But imho it went a bit downhill. Syngress was independent before it has been bought by Elsevier. Ask some scientists about them and their rejection of the Open Access Model, you'll see...

## Essentials

With these books you're covering some basics. Call'em must-reads.

**Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software**</br>Charles Petzold</br>Microsoft Press, 1999
</br><font size="1"><https://www.charlespetzold.com/books/></font>

> You haven't read this book? Read it! Thank me later.</br> Charles Petzold is taking us along on the journey of *code*. We're starting with the morse alphabet and the braille language. We talk about signs and symbols. We learn the very basics of electrical circuits. Then we're exploring boolean logic, learn about logic gates and watch our circuits becoming more complex. What about numbers in general? Where do they come from? Decimal, octal, binary and hexadecimal - Petzold explains all of this so well. It's never the cold shower, it's a warming bathtub. One of my all time favorites!

**Understanding the Digital World: What You Need to Know about Computers, the Internet, Privacy, and Security**</br>Brian W. Kernighan</br>Princeton University Press, 2017
</br><font size="1"><https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176543/understanding-the-digital-world/></font>

> This book truly is amazing. We know Kernighan wrote some famous books on programming. This one is different. Kernighan explains *everything* from the very beginning. And he assumes that you know (almost) nothing. What is a computer? How does the CPU work (the toy computer!), what about RAM and Storage? Bits, bytes, binary, algorithms - he has it all. What are programming languages? What are the principles of Operating Systems? And what is this arcane and mysterious internet all about? He closes this book with smart words on security and privacy. This book is great for total newbies and for professionals who think they know it all. Spoiler: you don't. Go, read it!

**DNS and BIND, 5th Edition**</br>Cricket Liu, Paul Albitz</br>O'Reilly, 2006
</br><font size="1"><https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/dns-and-bind/0596100574/></font>

> Nothing to annotate here. It's always DNS...

**The Imitation Game: Alan Turing Decoded**</br>Jim Ottaviani, Illustrator Leland Purvis</br> Abrams ComicArts, 2016
</br><font size="1"><https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/imitation-game_9781419718939/></font>

> Ok, this one is special. If you've never read a graphic novel, things might get complicated for you.</br>But... It's simply an extraordinary encounter with a genius. It is a very well researched, historically and technically accurate biography. You'll explore the math and the cryptography - bombes! You'll meet Alan Turing and his inner and outer demons. Welcome to Bletchley Park, let's crack the Enigma!

**Inside the Machine. An illustrated Introduction to Microprocessors and Computer Architecture**</br>Jon Stokes</br>No Starch Press, 2007</br>
<font size="1"><https://nostarch.com/search/node/Inside%20the%20Machine></font>

> Ok, published 2007, it's gotten a bit long in the tooth. In these days, Intelâ€™s latest processors were the Pentium M, Core, and Core2Duo. Still very good for learning how microprocessors/ CPUs work. Fetch, decode, execute... Certainly a good preparation before diving into Tanenbaum et al...

## IT-Security

**Attacking Network Protocols: A Hacker's Guide to Capture, Analysis, and Exploitation**</br>James Forshaw</br>No Starch Press, 2017</br>
<font size="1"><https://nostarch.com/networkprotocols></font>

> This one could make it to "The Essentials"... Know your f***ing protocols. Suitable for beginners and pros alike. I like it so much!

**DNS Security. Defending the Domain Name System**</br>Allan Liska and Geoffrey Stowe</br> Syngress, 2016</br>
<font size="1"><https://www.elsevier.com/books/dns-security/liska/978-0-12-803306-7></font>

> Mainly this one is about *understanding* DNS. And its common security problems. It's about configuration errors, server vulnerabilities and exploits. Liska and Stowe will introduce you to a variety of tools and techniques - both for Windows and Linux alike. Highly recommended!

**Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications**</br>Niels Ferguson, Bruce Schneier, Tadayoshi Kohno</br>Wiley, 2010</br>
<font size="1"><https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Cryptography+Engineering%3A+Design+Principles+and+Practical+Applications+-p-9780470474242></font>

> Really good to learn this spooky and arcane cryptography stuff.

**Metasploit. The Penetration Tester's Guide**</br>David Kennedy, Jim O'Gorman, Deavon Kearns, Mati Aharoni, 2011</br>
<font size="1"><https://nostarch.com/metasploit></font>

> Classic. You wanna learn metasploit? Look no further...

## Windows

**Mastering Windows Server 2003**</br>Mark Minasi</br>Wiley, 2003
</br><font size="1"><https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Mastering%3Csup%3E%3Csmall%3ETM%3C+small%3E%3C+sup%3E+Windows%3Csup%3E%C2%AE%3C+sup%3E+Server+2003-p-9780782141306></font>

> Yes, it is old. But imho this is still one of the best books you can grab if you wanna learn how Microsoft's Server-OS works. Minasi has his own style - and I like it.

**Windows 10 Inside Out, 4th Edition**</br>Ed Bott and Craig Stinson</br>Microsoft Press, 2020
</br><font size="1"><https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-10-inside-out-9780136784159></font>

</br><font size="1"><https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-server-2019-inside-out-9780135492277></font>

**Troubleshooting with the Windows Sysinternals Tools, 2nd Edition**</br>Mark E. Russinovich and Aaron Margosis</br>Microsoft Press, 2016
</br><font size="1"><https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/troubleshooting-with-the-windows-sysinternals-tools-9780735684447></font>

> No Windows admin can survive without the sysinternals tools. This books is the bible on how to use them. It's stuffed with insights in the OS and full of practical guidelines. Must read.

### Active Directory

**Active Directory Cookbook, 4th Edition**</br>Robbie Allen, Brian Svidergol</br>
O'Reilly, 2013
</br><font size="1"><https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/active-directory-cookbook/9781449361419/></font>

### Windows Internals

**Windows Internals, Part 1: System architecture, processes, threads, memory management, and more, 7th Edition**</br>Pavel Yosifovich, Mark E. Russinovich, David A. Solomon, Alex Ionescu</br>Microsoft Press, 2017
</br><font size="1"><https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-internals-part-1-system-architecture-processes-9780735684188/></font>

**Windows Internals, Part 2, 7th Edition**</br>Mark E. Russinovich, Andrea Allievi, Alex Ionescu, David A. Solomon</br>Microsoft Press, 2021
</br><font size="1"><https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-internals-part-2-9780135462409/></font>

> The beasts of the Windows OS literature. Long hours of reading, re-reading. Despair. Crying yourself to sleep. Imposter syndrome is strong with this one.</br> But it's a must-read. It's hard, but rewarding. You want to understand Windows under the hood? You want to attack it? Defend it? Know how stuff works...There are few books covering the internals this deep. I mean, lookup the authors if you're not familiar with these names... See?

## Linux

### Linux System Administration

**The Linux Command Line. Fourth Internet Edition**</br>William Shotts</br>2017, under Creative Commons by-nc-nd 3.0</br>
<font size="1"><https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php/></br></font>

> More than 500 pages of knowledge. From a2ps to zless. When I have questions, this is my first go-to. Not DuckDuckGo. Shotts.

**Beginning the Linux Command Line**</br>Sander van VugtApress, 2015</br>
<font size="1"><https://www.apress.com/gp/book/></font>

> This is very good for beginners (ahhh, the title...). Seriously, this book rocks. Only you and the shell. "This is Linux for those of us who donâ€™t mind typing. (...) Beginning the Linux Command Line (...) follows a taskâ€“oriented approach which is distribution agnostic."(<font size="1"><https://www.apress.com/gp/book/></font>)

## Coding

### Powershell

> This is *the* trilogy to read. If you wanna learn Powershell, look no further. Ok, some folks call these "in a year of lunches", but hey, nobody suddenly wakes up and knows it all. It's hard work to become a good Powershell user/scripter/toolmaker.</br> Don Jones and Jeffrey Hicks will help you all the way. The didactics: perfect! You should read them one after the other.

### Python
